# Scrabble
Simple Scrabble Game made in C# .NET Core

Data is manipulated through text files. So all methods are synchronous. Just download the code and build and run. (Created with Visual Studio 2019)

How to Run the game:

Download the code and run through Visual studio / VS Code. There is no need to set up any databases. Just build and run :)

How to Play the game:

Each game consists of two players. 
When a player starts the game, form a word from the tray of letters. If the word is valid, it will print it on the board and assign points to the player.
Then the turn will be passed on to the next player.
After the first word is formed, the consecutive words should be created using the letters in the board.
Select a letter from the board and form a new word with the selected letter and other letters from the tray

The game ends when a plyer gives up on a turn by typing "yeild". This will pass the round to the next player for one last go. After that the game will end and the winner will be the player with the highest score.
